Hello!

To the people that are checking this out... I had to change small
thing in your shell scripts in order to get them to work with my machine...

here are all the changes I made and you can confirm
- launch.sh : changed python3 to python (line 8, 11)
- test_case_1 : changed python3 to python (line 34)
- test_case_2 : changed python3 to python (line 32)
- test_case_3 : changed python3 to python (line )
- test_case_4 : changed python3 to python (line 42)
- verify_and_run : changed python3 to python (line 57)

Ill be honest... I fucked up my path somehow while setting up my school PC and python3 just isn't recognized. Im lazy so I just changed the scripts. This is why I use venv or conda :/
Anyways sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯....

Also python ain't my native language... dont judge to hard
